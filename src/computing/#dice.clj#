;; Given the observed average from rolling a six-sided die many times,
;; what are the probabilities associated with each side of the die.
;; For a fair die, all sides are equally likely, such that the
;; probability is 1/6 for each side.  If we roll the fair die
;; thousands of times, the distribution of observed averages will be
;; centered around 3.5.  Suppose, however, we observe an average of
;; 4.5.  There are an infinite number of probability sequences that
;; would yield a distribution centered around 4.5.  We find the
;; distribution that is centered around the empirical average AND that
;; maximizes the entropy around the empirical average, subject to the
;; constraint that the probabilities sum to one.  This is a
;; prototypical example in information theory.

;; There are two functions that are surfaced:
;; Example:
;;   (prob-seq 4.5) => (0.054 0.079 0.114 0.165 0.240 0.347)
;; Example:
;;   (graph-probs 4.5) => ... bar chart of above probabilities ...
